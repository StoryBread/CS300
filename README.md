-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem we solved in this course was creating a data structure to hold a large list of courses that should be sortable and searchable.

-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

We explored multiple types of data structures, considered their pro's and con's and then chose one. We then implemented a way to read a datafile, store it into the structure we created, and interacted with that structure we created.
Using the appropriate data structure can save you valuable resources. Especially when you consider that this program could be a dependency for another one. 

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Extensive testing, searching, and watching youtube videos helped a lot for solving problems once I ran into roadblocks. 

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project really nailed down the importance of solving problems with different tools. Different data structures exist for a reason.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I understood that projects should be modular, but this problem really showed why that's so important. I got to re-use portions of code and pseudocode which saved me alot of rework. It was extremely valueable.
